# [The IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) Challenge](https://www.iarpa.gov/challenges/fmow.html)


Intelligence analysts, policy makers, and first responders around the world rely on geospatial land use data to inform crucial decisions about global defense and humanitarian activities. Historically, analysts have manually identified and classified geospatial information by comparing and analyzing satellite images, but that process is time consuming and insufficient to support disaster response. The fMoW Challenge sought to foster breakthroughs in the automated analysis of overhead imagery by harnessing the collective power of the global data science and machine learning communities; empowering stakeholders to bolster their capabilities through computer vision automation.
The challenge published one of the largest publicly available satellite-image datasets to date, with more than one million points of interest from around the world. The dataset also contains other elements such as temporal views, multispectral imagery, and satellite-specific metadata that researchers can exploit to build novel algorithms capable of classifying facility, building, and land use.

SpaceNet is hosting the fMoW dataset in the spacenet repository to ensure easy access to the data.
